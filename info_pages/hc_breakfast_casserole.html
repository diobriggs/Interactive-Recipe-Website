            <!-- Ingredients list -->
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="ingredients-list">
                <li>Flour – may use all-purpose flour or gluten-free flour blend, if needed. For gluten-free flours, we always reach for Bob’s Red Mill Gluten Free 1-to-1 Baking Flour</li>
                <li>Baking powder</li>
                <li>Butter – may sub olive oil and cooking spray, if desired</li>
                <li>Eggs – you’ll need 6 large eggs</li>
                <li>Cheddar cheese – Cheddar is delish, but other shredded cheeses like Swiss or Colby Jack work, too. Pepper Jack is great, if you want to add a little kick</li>
                <li>Ham – look for a package of diced ham or cut your own from a thick ham steak (ask the grocery store deli counter to cut a 6-ounce thick slice of ham for you). You could also use chopped deli ham or use leftover ham from a roast </li>
                <li>Onion – We used yellow onion but feel free to use sweet, white, or red onion if that’s what you have on hand. Sliced green onions will also work </li>
                <li>Sweet bell pepper – adds a boost of potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C</li>
                <li>Salt and black pepper – you’ll need ½ teaspoon salt plus more to taste</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- Directions list -->
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol class="directions-list">
                <li>Preheat oven and prep the dish: Generously grease the bottom and sides of a 2 1/2-quart casserole dish (or 9-inch casserole dish) with butter and set aside. This will make it easy to remove every bit of delicious breakfast casserole from the dish (and easier cleanup, too!)</li>
                <li>Stir the base mixture: Combine the flour, baking powder, salt, milk, melted butter, and an egg in a large bowl. Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish, then sprinkle the batter with cheese. </li>
                <li>Make the egg mixture: Saute the onions and pepper in a little butter until they start to get tender. To the bowl that you used for the batter, add the remaining eggs, milk, and melted butter. Stir in the sautéed veggies and diced ham, then pour this mixture over the batter in the baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bake the egg casserole: Sprinkle the remaining cheese over top and bake until the edges are golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool 5 minutes before serving with toppings. </li>
